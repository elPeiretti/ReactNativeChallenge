# react-native-challenge
10-day coding challenge using React Native to test my learning, programming and planification skills. This challenge starts the 26/2/2023 and ends the 13/3/2023.
> Why React Native?
> I choosed this framework because I've already made a To-do list with it, but was not satisfied with the result. Also, I like the 'live' updating of the app, it saves time re-building the app every time a change is made.

## Rules
Here are the rules to follow:
- 6 hours of work per day maximum.
- No coding on the weekend.
- Use of two branches at least. One of them has to be for the baseline.
- Do several commits. Do not commit all the changes made in a day in one single commit.
- Every merge to the baseline must be done through a Pull Request.
- Documentate changes, additions, problems and solutions for each day in this file.
- Must do some planification on day 1.
